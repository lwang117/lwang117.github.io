# Cultural resources in the Mid-Atlantic region {#CR}


<h4> 
Integrating cultural and natural resource conservation is critical for successful large landscape conservation. We are assessing the spatial distribution and values of cultural resource using three approaches: 1) compiling existing databases to develop multi-layer cultural resource maps; 2) ethnographic work and surveys with cultural resource experts; and 3) leveraging crowd-sourced landscape values from Twitter data. Check out a [publication](https://gispoint.de/fileadmin/user_upload/paper_gis_open/DLA_2019/537663009.pdf) from this work.</h4>

# TREKS: Trails, routemaking, ecological knowledge and stewardship study {#EE}

<h4> 
By engaging with and actively shaping landscapes, trailbuilding communities come to know landscapes as storied social spaces. This study asks how trails come into being, both physically and as imagined landscapes by their creators, managers, and users. Research is situated ethnographically both virtually and in the Mid-Atlantic and Sierra Nevada regions, where existing long distance trails (the AT and PCT) and proposed trail management plans shape local conservation and recreation landscapes. Visit the [OSF page](https://osf.io/atdkx/) for updates.</h4>
